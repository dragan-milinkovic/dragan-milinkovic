```html
```

or any stray ``` anywhere above your content.

To be safe, your **first line** should literally be:

```html
<div align="center">
```

No spaces before it.

## ✅ Hard reset method (this always works)

Do this **exactly**:

1. Open repo:  
   `https://github.com/dragan-milinkovic/dragan-milinkovic`

2. Click **README.md → Edit**

3. **Delete EVERYTHING**

4. Paste ONLY this minimal test:

```html
<h1>Dragan Milinkovic</h1>
<p>This is my profile README test.</p>
```

5. Commit to `main`

6. Go to your profile page  
   `https://github.com/dragan-milinkovic`

If **this** does not show, then one of:
- Repo name is wrong
- Repo is private
- You are not logged into the correct account

There is no other possibility.

## 🧪 If it still doesn’t show, I need ONE thing
Send **exactly this** (nothing else):

👉 **The URL of the repository** you believe is the profile repo

Example:
```
https://github.com/dragan-milinkovic/dragan-milinkovic
```

Once I see the URL, I can tell you the issue in **one message**, guaranteed.
